# Epileptic Seizure Detection using a CNN and implemented using the Deeplearning4j library.

I show here how we can use Convolutional Neural Network, implemented with Deeplearning4j library to detect Epileptic Seizure from images generated from EEG (electroencephalogram) signals. This implementation follows the original work presented in the paper [Epileptic Seizure Detection Using a Convolutional Neural Network](http://oatao.univ-toulouse.fr/24138/).
